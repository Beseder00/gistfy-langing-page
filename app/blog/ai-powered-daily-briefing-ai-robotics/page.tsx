  content: `
    <p>Discover unexpected insights and emerging trends that human readers would miss—Gistify AI doesn't just summarize your newsletters, it connects the dots across dozens of AI and robotics sources, revealing hidden patterns and opportunities that give you a decisive edge in your field.</p>

    <h2>What is Gistify?</h2>
    <p>Gistify is an innovative app that harnesses artificial intelligence to deliver daily briefings tailored to your interests in AI and robotics. Whether you're a tech executive, researcher, or enthusiast, Gistify saves you time by diving into your inbox—think TLDR AI, Superhuman, or Mindstream—and pulling out the key stories from the newsletters you already receive. No more endless scrolling or information overload. With Gistify, you get the gist, instantly.</p>
    
    <p>Gistify combines cutting-edge AI with a sleek, user-friendly interface to keep you ahead of the curve. But what makes it truly special? Let's dive into how it works and why it's a game-changer.</p>

    <h2>How Gistify Works: A Quick Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Getting started with Gistify is effortless—just connect your inbox and let the AI do the rest. Here's how it transforms your daily routine:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Connect Your Inbox:</strong> Log in to the Gistify dashboard and link your email account. Gistify automatically detects newsletters like AI Breakfast at 8:32 AM or Ben's Bites at 9:05 AM, no manual selection needed.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Powered Scanning:</strong> Gistify's Gist Engine springs into action, analyzing every newsletter in your inbox—whether it's The Rundown AI's ASI roadmap at 9:45 AM or Superhuman's robotics drop at 11:30 AM. In seconds, it identifies key stories, prioritizes insights, and filters out the noise—no human could process this volume so fast.</li>
      <li><strong>Get Your Briefing:</strong> Each day, you receive a concise, AI-generated summary on your dashboard. It's not just a recap—it's a smart analysis with punchy insights, deep links to original sources, and options to bookmark key points for later.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Take a look at the dashboard in action:</p>

    <p>From there, explore features like Smart Bookmarking to save insights effortlessly—say, a highlight from AI Valley—or Deep Linking to jump straight to the sources that matter, like FutureTools' AI hardware updates. It's all designed to keep you informed without slowing you down.</p>

    <h2>Why Gistify Stands Out</h2>
    <p>Gistify isn't just another news tool—it's a productivity powerhouse. Here's what sets it apart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ultra-Concise Summaries:</strong> Our AI condenses sprawling newsletters like Chamath Weekly into short, impactful insights. Think of it as your executive brief, ready in moments.</li>
      <li><strong>AI-Driven Perspectives:</strong> Beyond summaries, Gistify uncovers key arguments and counterpoints—perfect for dissecting Department of Product's take on Gemini powers or TAAFT's AI espionage warnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> "Gistify cut my reading time by 80%," says Jane, a tech executive and early adopter. "I stay on top of AI trends without drowning in emails from Lenny's Newsletter or Product Hunt Daily."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Jane's story isn't unique. Elite operators worldwide are turning to Gistify to streamline their workflows and stay ahead in fast-moving fields like AI and robotics.</p>

    <h2>Real Impact: A User's Perspective</h2>
    <p>Take Mark, a robotics researcher: "Before Gistify, I spent hours scanning my inbox for newsletters like Mindstream's robotics updates or The Weekly Kaitchup's model breakthroughs. Now, Gistify pulls it all together into a daily briefing that's spot-on—plus, I can bookmark insights for my projects. It's like having a research assistant who never sleeps."</p>

    <p>Mark's experience highlights Gistify's real-world value. By letting AI tackle your inbox, you free up time for what matters—whether that's strategizing, innovating, or simply enjoying your morning coffee.</p>
